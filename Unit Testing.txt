Created CardLoader, Card, Hand
Edited MySprite.box

Adds CardLoader and Card - tackles redundant loading checks
- CardTextures
- Card
	x 1. Adds an id to ids, but only when it is new.
		! Uses a generator. May be slow in the future.
			Test loading all images from a directory.
			See if this works with a compiled .exe.
	x 2. Finds the index, grabs a texture based on that index
	x New cards requesting the same id do not reload texture.

Create the hands for both players.
	- Hand
		x 3. Hand draws cards in a row.
			x cleanup box.center_row/column
		x Card added, row updates
		x Create Opponent settings
			x Smaller Cards
			x Different Position

Hide the opponent's hand.
	- Card
		x 4. Card flips
		x Card flip copies card base...
			x Positioning
			x Sizing
	- Hand
		x May flip cards in iteration

Next...
Create an 'event' where the opponent reveals their hand.
Test this event with networking.
