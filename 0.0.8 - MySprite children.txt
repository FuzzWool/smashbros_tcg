0.0.8 - 01/07/13
Fixed MySprite for realsies.
	- No longer uses position, uses goto instead (for overriding, for child movements)
		- goto is called for all positioning events
	- Changing w and h is absolute, accessing subclass is illegal
		- size, points and boundary now work as intended as a result
	- Added children to MySprite
		- will follow the parent's goto/size (proportionally)
